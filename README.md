# WaterfallCollectionViewLayout

A Xamarin.iOS component for working with Pinterest-like UICollectionViews (i.e. waterfall UICollectionViews). It is based on the Objective-C version [UIWaterfallCollectionViewLayout](https://github.com/chiahsien/UICollectionViewWaterfallLayout), by Nelson. Eventually, the project plans to be ported fully into C# (instead of being exposed as a binding) to increase extensibility and customization.

## Getting Started
Coming soon! 

### Cursory
1. Download the repository by either cloning it or downloading it as a zip file.
2. Grab the .dll from the demo project and reference it in your Xamarin.iOS application.
3. Add a "using" directive to the file you wish to use WaterfallCollectionViewLayout in.
4. Follow basic UICollectionView principles for implementation, and check out the demo for the quirks of WaterfallCollectionViewLayout.

A more comprehensive "Getting Started" is coming soon!

## Documentation
Coming soon! In the meantime, check out the Xamarin Documentation Team's [post](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/ios/user_interface/introduction_to_collection_views) on UICollectionViews!

## Demo Project
The demo project in the repository works great, however, it's not an ideal use case. I'll be updating the demo, along with possibly some other demos, in due time.

## Contributing
All contributions are welcome! Whether you are a seasoned programmer, or just getting your start, you can help out. You don't have to be a programming superhero to improve the project! Check out the list of things below that generally need to be done, and contribute as you will!

* File issues: Please be as descriptive as possible! If someone else has filed a bug, try to reproduce the issue and provide as much information as possible, including version numbers, test cases, and any other helpful information.
* Troll the [Xamarin Forums](http://forums.xamarin.com/): If issues relating to WaterfallCollectionView appear, you may want to hop in and help out! If people are experiencing issues, feel free to file a bug.
* Update documentation: If things change, feel free to update the README or any of the supporting documentation for the project, add wiki pages, or create more samples!
* Update samples: Samples fall in and out of date, so sometimes they will needed updating. Additionally, sometimes the current way things are written *work* but are not *ideal*. 
* Create samples: If you feel like the current demo project isn't doing the project justice, feel free to create your own demo and submit it as a pull request.
* Fix bugs: Just as we need help filing bugs, we need help fixing the same bugs. Be sure to comment on the issue and let people know you are working on a fix!
* Convert to C#: The library is currently exposed as a binding library, so in the future, it would be nice to convert this code from Objective-C to C# for more versatility. The original library is just under 200 lines, so in C# it would most likely be much less than this.

Remember, no matter what you do, feel free to help out! Getting involved in open-source was one of the best things that ever happened to my coding ability.
